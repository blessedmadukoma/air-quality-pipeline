# AIR QUALITY PIPELINE PROJECT

## Project Description
This project is an Air Quality Pipeline Project that collects air quality data from the [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/) and stores it in DuckDB. The data is then analyzed and visualized to get insights into the air quality in different cities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- DuckDB
- Plotly

## Features Summary
1. Data Collection:
   - The data is collected from the OpenAQ API
   - The data is then stored in DuckDB
2. Data Engineering:
   - The data is cleaned and pre-processed
3. Data Analysis and Visualization:
   - The data is analyzed and visualized to get insights into the air quality in different cities
4. Machine Learning: **(TBD)**
    - A Machine Learning model is used to predict future air quality
5. Deployment: **(TBD)**
    - The project is deployed on Heroku

## How To Run The Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Activate the virtual environment by running:
   - `python -m venv .venv` and
   - `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
<!-- 4. Run the Jupyter notebook file named `budget.ipynb` -->
